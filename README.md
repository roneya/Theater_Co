# Theater_Co
Theater Co is a ticket booking backend system for movies in theaters. It aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for movie-goers to book their tickets online. The system is built using Springboot, Hibernate, SQL, and Lombok technologies, and is designed for audiences who want to book movie tickets from the comfort of their own homes.

The Theater Co system offers a range of features, including the ability to book and manage movie tickets for different shows and theaters. Users can view a list of available movies, show timings, seat types, and their respective rates. The system also allows users to cancel their tickets and obtain a refund for the amount paid.

One of the key benefits of the Theater Co system is the ability to maintain an accurate record of ticket bookings and refunds, ensuring that users can easily keep track of their transactions. Additionally, the system provides real-time information about seat availability, making it easier for users to make informed decisions about their bookings.

In the future, the Theater Co project plans to expand into a full-stack project with a React front-end and deploy it on AWS or Azure, with a SQL database for commercial purposes testing. These efforts will further enhance the user experience and provide a reliable platform for movie-goers to book their tickets online.
